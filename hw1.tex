\problem{Problem 1.} The counterexample is the following graph:

\problem{Problem 2.} We first show that $c_1=1/2$. This is easy to see because in the worst case the algorithm chooses a path of length 1, and then if the matching is composed of a bunch of subgraphs consisting of an edge going from one side to the other and then an edge going from that node back to the first side (like a $<$ or $>$ shape), then we have $|M_1|/|M^{\ast}|=1/2$.

On the second iteration, the algorithm picks blocking paths of size 2, and in the general $k$th step it picks blocking paths of size $k$. Hence the minimal matching is increasing by \emph{at least} 1 every iteration. We have $|M^{\ast}|$ as the least upper bound for $|M_k|$, so by a basic theorem of analysis, we must have $c_k\to 1$ as $k\to\infty$.

\problem{Problem 4.} 
\problempart{a} Fix a vertex $i \in L$ and let the event
\[
A_j = \{\text{vertex } i \text{ is matched with vertex } j \in R\}
\] 
Let's call a vertex matched if the edge $(i,j)$ is in the output of the stateless rounding procedure. Then 
\[
P(\{\text{vertex } i \text{ is matched}\}) = P( \bigcup_{j\in R} A_j )
\]
For a single event $A_k$ we have that 
\[
P(A_k) = x_{ik}z_k^{-1}
\]
Because the events $A_k$ are not independent
